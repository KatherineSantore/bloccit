        <p>I am Ivy League educated with a Master of Philosophy in Organizational Dynamics, Organizational Consulting and Executive Coaching with a 4.0 GPA. I received my B.A. in Communications with a concentration in Human Relations. I also have an M.S. in Leadership and Strategic Management and a graduate certificate in Nonprofit Management from Manhattanville College. Professionally, I work in leadership coaching and learning  and development consulting at a financial services institution. I was an adjunct professor at Western Connecticut State University, where I taught Interpersonal Communications, Public Speaking, and other Communication Classes until I began my studies at UPenn.</p>
        <p>I believe your education gives you the credentials and flexibility to define your future. Helping others achieve their academic goals is a passion of mine that I turned into a small business. I work with high school students, graduate school applicants, and parents to develop a customized plan to coach them towards academic success and program admissions. I believe in a mentoring based approach, where I strive to get to know each student (and their family) and forge an ongoing relationship based on trust, coaching, and goal orientation. I have never worked with a student who did not go onto to pursue a degree in a program they were satisfied with. My experience is vast and I've worked to assist people in the application process to undergraduate, graduate, MBA, medical, and law school. </p>

        <p> In addition to college admissions consulting, I offer SAT verbal and writing prep, both major selection and career coaching, interview preparation, and resume and cover letter creation or revisions. I am available evenings and weekends to work one on one or in small groups with students in the Connecticut, and Westchester, NY area. I also do skype/ FaceTime appointments so distance is not a problem. My business is 100% referral based, and I am pleased to work with clientâ€™s siblings, family members, and neighbors. </p>
